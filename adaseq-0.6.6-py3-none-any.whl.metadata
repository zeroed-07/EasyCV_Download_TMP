## Introduction
***AdaSeq*** (**A**libaba **D**amo **A**cademy **Seq**uence Understanding Toolkit) is an easy-to-use all-in-one library, built on [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/home), that allows researchers and developers to train custom models for sequence understanding tasks, including part-of-speech tagging (POS Tagging), chunking, named entity recognition (NER), entity typing, relation extraction (RE), etc.

<summary>üåü <b>Features:</b></summary>

- **Plentiful Models**:

  AdaSeq provide plenty of cutting-edge models, training methods and useful toolkits for sequence understanding tasks.

- **State-of-the-Art**:

  Our aim to develop the best implementation, which can beat many off-the-shelf frameworks on performance.

- **Easy-to-Use**:

  One line of command is all you need to obtain the best model.

- **Extensible**:

  It's easy to register a module, or build a customized sequence understanding model by assembling the predefined modules.

</details>

‚ö†Ô∏è**Notice:** This project is under quick development. This means some interfaces could be changed in the future.

## üì¢ What's New
- 2022-07: [SemEval 2023] Our U-RaNER paper won [Best Paper Award](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2023/awards)!
- 2022-03: [SemEval 2023] Our U-RaNER won ***1st place in 9 tracks*** at [SemEval 2023 Task2](https://multiconer.github.io/results): Multilingual Complex Named Entity Recognition! [Model introduction and source code can be found here](./examples/U-RaNER).
- 2022-12: [[EMNLP 2022] Retrieval-augmented Multimodal Entity Understanding Model (MoRe)](./examples/MoRe)
- 2022-11: [[EMNLP 2022] Ultra-Fine Entity Typing Model (NPCRF)](./examples/NPCRF)

## ‚ö° Quick Experience
You can try out our models via online demos built on ModelScope:
[[English NER]](https://modelscope.cn/models/damo/nlp_raner_named-entity-recognition_english-large-news/summary)
[[Chinese NER]](https://modelscope.cn/models/damo/nlp_raner_named-entity-recognition_chinese-base-news/summary)
[[CWS]](https://modelscope.cn/models/damo/nlp_structbert_word-segmentation_chinese-base/summary)

More tasks, more languages, more domains: All modelcards we released can be found in this page [Modelcards](./docs/modelcards.md).

## üíæ Dataset Zoo
We collected many datasets for sequence understanding tasks. All can be found in this page [Datasets](./docs/datasets.md).

## üì¶ Installation
AdaSeq project is based on `Python >= 3.7`, `PyTorch >= 1.8` and `ModelScope >= 1.4`. We assure that AdaSeq can run smoothly when `ModelScope == 1.9.5`.

- installation via pipÔºö
```
pip install adaseq
```

- installation from sourceÔºö
```
git clone https://github.com/modelscope/adaseq.git
cd adaseq
pip install -r requirements.txt -f https://modelscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/releases/repo.html
```

### Verify the Installation
To verify whether AdaSeq is installed properly, we provide a demo config for training a model (the demo config will be automatically downloaded).
```
adaseq train -c demo.yaml
```
You will see the training logs on your terminal. Once the training is done, the results on test set will be printed: `test: {"precision": xxx, "recall": xxx, "f1": xxx}`. A folder `experiments/toy_msra/` will be generated to save all experimental results and model checkpoints.
